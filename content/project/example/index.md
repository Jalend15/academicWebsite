Improved the accuracy of prediction by 2 percent by incorporating stance classification in Tree LSTM-
based rumour detection from ”Going Beyond Content Richness: Verified Information Aware Summarization of
Crisis-Related Microblogs”.

Preprocessed PHEME dataset for ”Cascade-LSTM: A Tree-Structured Neural Classifier for Detecting Misinfor-
mation Cascades” by matching the relevant features to detect misinformation in the PHEME dataset.
