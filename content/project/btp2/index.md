Explored the conversations in ”The Big Bang Theory”, an American television sitcom to detect sarcasm in speech.

Classified the speech as sarcasm based on contextual parameters like speakers, the emotion of the characters
present and presence of a laughter track during the speech drawn from the sitcom dataset.

Developed a model using transfer learning to obtain an F1-Score close to 75.00 on classified twitter data.
